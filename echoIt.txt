Echo It!
Nice work! PHP computed the value for you, but it didn't appear in your .php document because we didn't print it using echo. Let's fix that!

Instructions
Let's finish this up! Beneath your existing PHP code, use echo to print out your name and your age, like so:

echo $myName;
echo $myAge;

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'/>
		<title>PHP FTW!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
        <!-- Write your PHP code below!-->
        <?php 
        $myName = "Hannah";
        $myAge = 27;
        echo "My name is " . $myName . ",";
        echo "<br>" . "I am " . $myAge ." years old.";
        ?>
        <p>
            
        </p>   
	</body>
</html>
