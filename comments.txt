Comments
Just like we sometimes put comments in our CSS (using /* this syntax */) or in our HTML (using <!-- this syntax -->), we can also put comments in our PHP code! We do that using two forward slashes (//), like so:

<?php
    echo "I get printed!";
    // I don't! I'm a comment.
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Oh No!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
        <p><?php //this is a comment
            echo "Oh, the humanity!";
          ?></p>
    </body>
</html>
