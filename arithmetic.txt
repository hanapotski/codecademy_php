Arithmetic
In addition to outputting strings, PHP can also do math.

<?php
  echo 5 * 7;
?>
Here we use echo to multiply 5 and 7, and we end our line of code with a semicolon. PHP will output 35.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
        <p>
          <?php
           echo 17*123;     
          ?>
        </p>
	</body>
</html>
